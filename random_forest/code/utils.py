    ----------
    X : an N by D numpy array
    Xtest: an T by D numpy array

    Returns: an array of size N by T containing the pairwise squared Euclidean distances.

    Python/Numpy (and other numerical languages like Matlab and R)
    can be slow at executing operations in `for' loops, but allows extremely-fast
    hardware-dependent vector and matrix operations. By taking advantage of SIMD registers and
    multiple cores (and faster matrix-multiplication algorithms), vector and matrix operations in
    Numpy will often be several times faster than if you implemented them yourself in a fast
    language like C. The following code will form a matrix containing the squared Euclidean
    distances between all training and test points. If the output is stored in D, then
    element D[i,j] gives the squared Euclidean distance between training point
    i and testing point j. It exploits the identity (a-b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab.
    The right-hand-side of the above is more amenable to vector/matrix operations.
